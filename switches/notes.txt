// Fall through can be achieved a few ways.
// If there is code in the previous case, add a comment with the text falls through just before the next case

// console.log("Hello")
// /* falls through */
// case:...

// if the previous case only has a condition and no code, and is intended to fall through,
// you can stack it directly above the next case without a falls through comment.

// case 6:
// case 7:

// place the falls through comment above the case you intend to fall through to
/*
// You can tell JSHint that you don't use break intentionally by
// adding a comment falls through on a line just before
// the next `case`. single line comments work too.
