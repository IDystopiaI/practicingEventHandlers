1. Website
    - Basic example using selectors to modify the DOM with selectors

2. Variables
    - printing strings, template literals, typeof keyword

3. Arithmetic
    - math
    - off topic dive into structedClone

4. Accept User Input
    1. through an alert containing an input field
    2. collecting from a field after the user clicks a button

5. Type Conversion
    - Changing the datatype of one value to another
        - strings, numbers, booleans

6. Constants
    - ties back into structuredClone; an object is mutable
    - creates immutable variables

7. Counter Program
    - a program that responds to incrementing/decrementing/resting a counter in response to what a user clicks on

8. Math
    - Math is an object in JavaScript
    - Many static methods live inside this object such as Math.floor()

9. Random
    - Working with Random in JavaScript

10. If Statements
    - Conditionals, some ternary

11. Checked Property
    - Determines the checked state of an HTML checkbox or radio button element
    - The .checked property is sued for both radio and checkboxes

12. Ternary operator
    - Alternative way of writing if statements
    - an example can be found in conditionals

13. Switches
    - very similar to if else statements, does not short-circuit (unlike other languages)
    - best to add break after each clause to prevent fallthrough

14. String methods
    - methods to manipulate and work with text
    - remember that strings are immutable in JS

15. String slicing
    - part of String methods

16. Method chaining
    - calling several methods one after another in one continuous line of code
    - not sure if "first class citizen" applies here or if that's more specific to functions

17. Logical operators
    - && || !

18. Strict equality
    - together with Logical operators
    - small bit of bitwise ~~

19. While loops
    - while loop = repeat some code while some condition is true

20. For loops
    - very short for loops lesson

21. Number guessing game
    - guessing is an attempt
    - guessing2 is an event driven revision
    - guessing3 makes use of prompts to pause a while loop

22. Functions
    - a section of reusable code.
    - Declare code once, use it wherever you want.
    - call the function to execute the code.

23. Variable scope
    - where a variable can be access from local/global

24. Temperature conversion program
    - Temperature conversion program making use of html, css and js

25. Arrays
26. Spread operator
27. Rest parameters
28. Dice Roller program
29. Random password generator
30. Callbacks
31. forEach()
32. map()
33. filter()
34. reduce()
35. Function expressions
36. Arrow functions
37. JavaScript Object
38. What is THIS

48. Sorting
49. Shuffle an array
50. Dates
51. Closures
52. setTimeout()
53. Digital Clock program
54. Stopwatch program
55. ES6 Modules
56. Asynchronous code
57. Error handling
58. Calculator program
59. What is the DOM?
60. Element selectors
61. DOM navigation
62. Add & change HTML
63. Mouse events
64. Key events
65. Hide/show HTML
66. NodeLists
67. classList
68. Rock Paper Scissors
69. Image Slider
